# React App for the Health Facility Registry in Sierra Leone

This is a React client for the Health Facility Registry in Sierra
Leone. Among other things, this aimed to be a rewrite of the
preexisting Angular client, and it's using the same backend. Here are
some pointers to the related repositories:

- [The Django backend](https://github.com/eHealthAfrica/health-facility-registry/)
- [The preexisting Angular client](https://github.com/eHealthAfrica/sl-health-facility-registry-client/)

While wrapping up the project, we were asked to bring the preexisting
Angular app to a stable state, while the content of this repo was
analysed for usage in other scenarios.

The [design doc](design/design.md) and other documents in that folder
represent the status of software design while the project was
interrupted, while the [FacilityDiff design
document](design/facilitydiff.md) exposes ideas about generalising the
React client in this repo and the related parts in the backend.

### Development

This uses [React
Scripts](https://github.com/firstlookmedia/react-scripts), so refer to
the documentation there for commands about building and serving.

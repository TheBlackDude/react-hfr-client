See the main repository's README for an introduction

facilitydiff.md -- notes about generalising this software
facilitydiff.svg -- same as above but more short and visual

The other files are about a development effort that has been
interrupted, so they are probably not going to be very valuable unless
the project will be restored.

design.md -- main software design document with some open questions
closed-design-questions.md -- closed software design questions
glossary.md -- the beginning of a glossary for our project

##### Registry

Short name for the Health Facility Registry, our product.

##### Data tree

where for example health facilities are contained into chiefdoms that
are contained into districts. A version of a similar data set is
called simply _a tree_ or a _data tree_.

##### Comparable entity

Entity that can be compared, for example an health facility or a chiefdom

##### Ignored differences

Inconsistencies that the user already decided to ignore

##### Difference status

The result of comparing entries. The difference status can be one of:
New, Deleted, Same, Different

##### Orphan entity

A comparable entity which is not linked to any parent. Such entities
are not reacheable by browsing the location tree so they need
dedicated navigation interfaces
